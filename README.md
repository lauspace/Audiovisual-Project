# Virtual Audio Amplifier Analyzer

This project is a Virtual Audio Amplifier Analyzer implemented with Matlab. This system measures some parameters of audio amplifiers, specifically those of type D, to estimate their quality. The parameters it measures are:
* Frequency Response
* Gain
* Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
* Total Harmonic Distortion and Noise (THD + N)
* Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)
